## v1.0.2

**Release date:** 3rd July 2024

**Contributors:** Amy Heather

Minor improvements following the first reproducibility assessment ([Shoaib and Ramamohan 2022](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-reproduce-shoaib-2022)).

### Added

* Template page (`reflections.qmd`) for reflections on facilitators and barriers to reproduction, and for full list of troubleshooting steps

### Changed

* Add `.vscode/` to `.gitignore`
* Add citation to protocol on quarto site home page
* Order of criteria in `badges.qmd` (so it is a consistent order between the dictionary of criteria names and results, making it easier when conducting the assessment to look between the two)
* Amended `TODO:` comments in CHANGELOG and GHCR GitHub action
* Add missing `<!--- -->` marker in `artefacts.qmd`
* Improved the "succesfully reproduced" template sentence in `reproduction_report.qmd`

## v1.0.1
