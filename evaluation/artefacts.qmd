<!-- TODO: Remove this warning once completed assessment -->
**Please note: This is a template page and has not yet been completed**

This page evaluates the extent to which the original study meets the recommendations for the sharing of code and associated materials. We compare against two standards:

* **Best practice audit** - requirements from the best practice audit by @monks_computer_2023. The items in this audit were based on @the_turing_way_community_turing_2022, @taylor_open_2017, and @the_open_modeling_foundation_omf_reusability_2024.
* **STARS** - recommendations from the recently published STARS framework by @monks_towards_2024.

## Best practice audit

Of the **11** items in this audit:

<!-- TODO: Add counts from evaluation -->
* **X** were met fully (‚úÖ)
* **X** was met partially (üü°)
* **X** was not met (‚ùå)

<!-- TODO: Fill in the table. Options are ‚úÖ Fully, üü° Partially, or ‚ùå Not met -->
| Item | Description | Met by study? | Evidence/location |
| - | - | :-: | - |
| Digital Object Identifier (DOI) | Does the model have a DOI and promise of persistence? Can it be cited? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) | Is the model linked to one or more of the authors via an ORCID? | <!----> | <!----> |
| License | Does the repository have a recognised open license to control the use of code, liabilty and credit? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Model overview | Is there an obvious file that provides an overview of the repository/model and it purpose (e.g. in README file)? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Link to published paper | Do models shared externally from journal articles contain a link to the published article? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Steps to run code | Does the readme file or similar describe the steps required to execute the simulation model? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Formal dependency management | Has a formal tool, e.g. renv, conda, or poetry been used to manage software dependencies for the simulation model? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Informal dependency management | Has an informal list or description of software, or OS dependencies been provided? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Code testing | Is there any evidence of tests that have been applied to the code to check that it functions correctly? | <!----> | <!----> |
| Local execution | Can the simulation model and associated files be downloaded and in theory executed on a local machine | <!----> | <!----> |
| Remote execution | Can the simulation model be executed online using free or commercial infrastructure? | <!----> | <!----> |

* **X** was met partially (üü°)
* **X** was not met (‚ùå)

Of the **5** optional STARS components:

<!-- TODO: Add counts from evaluation -->
* **X** was met fully (‚úÖ)
* **X** were not met (‚ùå)

<!-- TODO: Fill in the table. Options are ‚úÖ Fully, üü° Partially, or ‚ùå Not met -->
